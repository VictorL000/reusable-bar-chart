# Reusable Bar Graph

This is my reusable bar graph for Jitto, and it can be accessed here [VictorL000.github.io/reusable-bar-graph](https://victorl000.github.io/resable-bar-graph).

Features:
- 
Some things to note:
- The text scales with the window width, not the draggable demo box.
- The tick algorithm finds the "nicest" tick number (e.g: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 ...) which can fit all data into the graph.

Next steps:
- Change the negative numbers so that the 0 is not in the center.
- Add more themes.
